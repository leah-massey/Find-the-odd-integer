# Codewars kata TDD practise

## The problem :

Given an array of integers, find the one that appears an odd number of times.

## Examples

<p>[7] should return 7, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).</p>
<p>[0] should return 0, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).</p>
<p>[1,1,2] should return 2, because it occurs 1 time (which is odd).</p>
<p>[0,1,0,1,0] should return 0, because it occurs 3 times (which is odd).</p>
<p>[1,2,2,3,3,3,4,3,3,3,2,2,1] should return 4, because it appears 1 time (which is odd).</p>
<p>[] should return 'Array must have at least one value'.</p>
<p>'a' throw error : format incorrect</p>
<p>[0,1,0,1,0,1] should return 'Multiple values appear an odd number of times'.</p>
<p>[0,1,1,0] should return 'No values appear an odd number of times'.</p>

Working on and refining my TDD processes.
